# ðŸ¤” Problem space

## Problems to solve/Requirements to Create

As a developer new to Next.js and full-stack development, I needed to create a comprehensive dashboard application that would help me understand modern web development practices while building something practical and functional.

### ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Learning curve of Next.js App Router and server components

**Problem statement**

Traditional React applications rely heavily on client-side rendering and state management. However, Next.js introduces a new paradigm with server components and the App Router architecture. As a developer new to these concepts, understanding when to use server vs. client components, how data fetching works, and how to structure an application with the App Router presented a significant learning challenge.

**Current solution**

Before this project, I was familiar with traditional React applications that use client-side rendering exclusively. The mental model shift required for Next.js development, particularly understanding server components and the App Router, was substantial.

**How do we know it is a problem**

- User feedback: Personal struggle with understanding the new concepts and architecture.
- Metrics: Initial development time was slower than expected due to the learning curve.
- Evidence: Documentation research and multiple iterations were needed to properly implement features.

### ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Database integration with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL

**Problem statement**

As my first time working with Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL databases, integrating these technologies into a Next.js application presented challenges in schema design, migrations, and efficient querying patterns.

**Current solution**

Prior to this project, I had limited experience with database ORMs and primarily used simpler data storage solutions without the robustness of a relational database.

**How do we know it is a problem**

- User feedback: Initial confusion about Prisma schema design and migration workflows.
- Metrics: Database queries were not optimized, leading to slower performance.
- Evidence: Debugging logs showed inefficient database access patterns.


## Why solve these problems?

Addressing these problems is crucial for developing modern, efficient web applications that provide excellent user experiences. Learning Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL is essential for creating production-ready applications that can scale and perform well.

**Reason 1**: Next.js App Router and server components provide significant performance benefits and improved developer experience once mastered.

**Reason 2**: Proper database integration with Prisma and PostgreSQL ensures data integrity, type safety, and efficient querying capabilities.

**User Satisfaction Matrix**

- Current State: Initial development was slower due to the learning curve, with some performance issues related to database queries and rendering optimizations.
- Desired State: After solving these problems, development will be more efficient with a clear understanding of Next.js patterns, and the application will perform optimally with proper database integration.

## Low-fidelity Wireframe

### Design Concept

The core design concept for ACME Dashboard centers on providing clear, actionable financial insights through an intuitive interface. The dashboard presents key metrics at a glance, with easy navigation to more detailed views for invoices and customer management.

**For admins:**

The admin dashboard provides tools for user management and system monitoring, ensuring the application runs smoothly and securely and provides a quick overview of financial performance, with cards showing total revenue, pending vs. paid invoices, and customer statistics. Navigation is simple and intuitive, allowing admins to quickly access the information they need.

## Design system ðŸŽ¨

For ACME Dashboard, I utilized Tailwind CSS to maintain consistency and ensure a seamless user experience across all pages and interactions. Here's why the design system was necessary and how I utilized it in the project

# Challenges Faced and Solutions 

### Problem 1:

**Understanding Next.js App Router and Server Components**

**Challenge:**

As a first-time Next.js developer, grasping the mental model of the App Router and server/client component separation was challenging. Understanding when to use "use client" directives and how data flows between server and client components required a significant learning curve.

### Solution 1:

To solve this, I implemented a structured learning approach:

- **Methodical Documentation Study:** Thoroughly studied the Next.js documentation and examples to understand the core concepts.
- **Component Boundaries:** Created clear separation between server and client components with proper "use client" directives where needed.
- **Data Flow Patterns:** Established consistent patterns for data fetching and state management, using server components for data fetching and client components for interactivity.

### Problem 2:

**Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL Integration**

**Challenge:**

Setting up and managing the database with Prisma presented challenges with schema design, migrations, and deployment in a serverless environment.

### Solution 2:

I addressed these challenges through:

- **Schema-First Approach:** Designed a complete database schema before implementation, focusing on entity relationships and data integrity.
- **Migration Strategy:** Used Prisma's migration system to manage schema changes safely throughout development.
- **Connection Pooling:** Implemented proper connection management for the serverless environment to prevent connection exhaustion.
- **Type Safety:** Leveraged Prisma's generated types for type-safe database access throughout the application.
